# Grit
Grit Side Project

This will be an open sourced CRM tool built with ASP.NET Core 2.2


# GRIT Stands for?
GRIT stands for Growth, Relations, and Interactions Terminal. This tool is set to redefine what CRM tools are meant to be. Yes, this is a CRM tool, but it is built in the mindset of a user, and how that user is able to see/manipulate data.
